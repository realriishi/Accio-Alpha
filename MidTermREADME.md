# WiDS Midterm Progress

This repository contains all the work I’ve done up to the midterm as part of the WiDS program. Most of the work here is in the form of Jupyter notebooks where I explored concepts by running code, tweaking parameters, and trying to understand what’s actually happening rather than just writing final answers.

## What I’ve done so far
### Week 1
Week 1 was about getting comfortable with the basics. I worked on probability questions and got introduced to NumPy and Matplotlib. This helped me understand how to handle arrays and visualize data using simple plots, which was completely new to me at the start.

### Week 2
In Week 2, I worked with regression and time series concepts. I used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for regression and performed stationarity testing using the ADF test. The main focus here was on reading and interpreting outputs like coefficients and p-values instead of going deep into derivations.

### Week 3
Week 3 focused on Kalman Filters. I used the provided implementation and experimented with parameters like process noise, measurement noise, and different initializations. By changing these values and observing the plots, I got a much better intuition for how the filter balances prediction and measurement using uncertainty.

## Final Note
Most of the work in this repository is exploratory. A lot of the understanding came from actually running the code, seeing what breaks or changes, and then making sense of the results rather than trying to get everything right on the first go.
